DMS332 Final Project

Title: TBA

Pitch: 3D Frogger/Crossy Road in 3rd-Person-POV

Audience and genre: 3D Platformer Game for people who enjoy the challenge of platformers and those who liked playing Frogger and Crossy Road

# Synopsis:

-Theme: The theme will vary depending on our progress and approach to the game

-Goals: Jump between a variety of platforms to reach checkpoints and eventually reach the end of the obstacle course

-Mechanics: Leap between platforms, dodge moving obstacles, pick up different items with unique uses

-Uniqueness: Frogger and Crossy Road with the mix of 3D elements and a jump button

Flowboard: The player will reach the end where the gate will be, but there are "cars" (might change) and other obstacles. The player also needs to obtain the keys along their way to open the gate.
